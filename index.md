## About Me

I obtained my PhD degree in robotics from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology under the supervision of Prof. [Michael Yu Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Oo7c22wAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Bertram Emil Shi](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=KaaF6ooAAAAJ&hl=en). My research focuses on vision-based tactile sensing. During my PhD, I visited the [MARS Lab](https://www.purduemars.com/) at Purdue University and worked with Prof. [Yu She](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r-dJcIsAAAAJ&hl=en) on the GelSight and Digit tactile sensors. I obtained my master's degree in Systems, Control and Robotics from KTH Royal Institute of Technology and finished my master thesis on "Learning Dynamical Features for Vision-based Tactile Sensors" at ETH Zurich supervised by Prof. [Raffaello D'Andrea](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FdGOel8AAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Carmelo Sferrazza](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x0_lwNYAAAAJ&hl=en). I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Michigan - Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute.
